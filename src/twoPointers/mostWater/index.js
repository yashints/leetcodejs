/*
11. Container With Most Water - Medium
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

const maxArea = (height) => {
  let max = 0;
  let left = 0,
    right = height.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    let area = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
    max = Math.max(max, area);
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return max;
